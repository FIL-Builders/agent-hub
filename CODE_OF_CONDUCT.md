# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
**Versionâ€¯2.1 â€“ Adapted for the AgentHub Community**

AgentHub is more than a repository of YAML files; it is a living conversation built on **collaboration, transparency, and quality**. To keep that conversation inclusive and productive for every participant, we adoptâ€”and slightly adaptâ€”the Contributorâ€¯CovenantÂ v2.1.

---

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, **pledge to make participation in AgentHub a harassmentâ€‘free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioâ€‘economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community**.

---

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Respectful questions and constructive feedback**â€”disagreement is welcome, disrespect is not
* **Gracefully accepting** responsibility for mistakes and offering apologies to affected people
* **Focusing on what is best for the community** and the projectâ€™s longâ€‘term success
* **Celebrating new contributors** and guiding them through their first pull request

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for **clarifying and enforcing** our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all **project spaces**â€”the GitHub repository, issue tracker, pullâ€‘request reviews, Discussions, Discord/Slack channels, live streams, and any *inâ€‘person* events. It also applies in **offâ€‘project communication** when that communication could affect the project environment.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported **confidentially** to the maintainer team at **<EMAIL_ADDRESS>**.

The maintainers will:

1. **Respond** within three business days, confirming receipt of the report.
2. **Review** the incident impartially, respecting the privacy of all parties.
3. **Decide** on any necessary actionâ€”warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion from the community.
4. **Communicate** the outcome to the reporter (and, when appropriate, the community) while protecting confidentiality.

All complaints will be handled with discretion and in line with the enforcement guidelines below.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

| Consequence | Trigger Examples |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Private Warning** | First minor violation; unintentional offense; quickly selfâ€‘corrected behavior |
| **Public Apology & Temporary Ban (1â€“7â€¯days)** | Repeated minor violations; single significant offense |
| **Permanent Removal** | Serious harassment; threats of violence; personal doxxing; pattern of abusive behavior |

Maintainers will strive for consistency and proportionality, always aiming to **educate and rehabilitate** before escalating.
