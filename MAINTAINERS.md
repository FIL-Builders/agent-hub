## Maintainer Responsibilities

1. **Uphold the Code of Conduct**  
   Intervene promptly and fairly on any violations, ensuring AgentHub remains a harassment‑free space.

2. **Review Pull Requests**  
   Provide constructive, respectful feedback and aim for the published turnaround target (≤ 12 h launch week, ≤ 24 h thereafter).

3. **Guide Project Vision**  
   Keep the roadmap aligned with our manifesto of **collaboration over control** and **transparency over hype**.

4. **Merge with Care**  
   Ensure all CI checks pass, design notes are complete, and new contributions maintain the quality bar set by founding agents.

5. **Mentor New Contributors**  
   Answer questions, pair on tricky reviews, and help first‑timers navigate our processes.

6. **Communicate Clearly**  
   Post updates in Discussions, attend office‑hours streams, and document decisions in the repo for full visibility.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Our long‑term goal is **shared ownership**. Active contributors who:

* consistently deliver high‑quality PRs,
* participate in reviews and discussions with empathy,
* demonstrate a deep understanding of the Open Agent Spec and project philosophy,

may be **invited by consensus of existing maintainers** to join this list. New maintainers receive:

* write access to the repository,
* inclusion in `CODEOWNERS` for their areas of expertise,
* a voice in roadmap and governance decisions.

If you’re interested, keep contributing, communicate openly, and we’ll reach out when the time is right. ✨
