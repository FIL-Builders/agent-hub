# AgentHub: A Manifesto for an Open, Collaborative Launch

---

## 1. Why We Pivoted — From “Big Bang” to Community Seed

AgentHub began with an ambitious idea: **“Ship 100 pre‑built agents and wow the internet.”**
On paper it sounded impressive—but it also risked two problems we care deeply about:

1. **Authenticity** – Mass‑generated assets feel like marketing, not craft.
2. **Trust** – A surprise drop positions outside developers as spectators, not partners.

So we re‑plotted our course. Instead of chasing volume and splashy numbers, we chose **quality, transparency, and conversation** as our north stars. We will **earn** the community’s confidence one meticulously written agent file at a time and invite developers to build the registry with us, not after us.

## 2. What AgentHub *Is* (and Intentionally *Is Not*)

| **We Are**                                                                                                       | **We Aren’t**                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **An open specification** (`Open Agent Spec v0.1`) that any LLM stack can read.                                  | A closed vendor format or one more proprietary “prompt framework.”                  |
| **A curated registry** of YAML agent files—each a distilled, peer‑reviewed guide to using a specific API or SDK. | A monolithic CLI or SDK. Developers copy‑paste—or parse—the YAML any way they like. |
| **A conversation starter**: every agent PR includes design notes, context, and room for debate.                  | A one‑click magic box. We value understanding over black‑box convenience.           |

*In short:* AgentHub is the **schema + library** layer of the AI toolchain, intentionally lightweight so it can slot into **any** workflow—today or tomorrow.

## 3. Our Three‑Phase Launch Story

### **Phase 1 – Building a Solid Foundation (Weeks 1‑5)**

**Goal:** Ship something we can be proud to show the world.

* **Open Agent Spec v0.1**
  *Public RFC, three external reviews minimum, v0.1 tag locked.*

* **Governance Starter Kit**
  Clear rules (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `MAINTAINERS`, `CODEOWNERS`) so newcomers know the handshake.

* **Founding Agents (10–15)**
  Hand‑crafted examples for React, Stripe, Postgres, etc., each with `.yaml`, passing CI, and a candid `DESIGN_NOTES.md`.

* **CI / Lint / Smoke Tests**
  A &lt; 90 s GitHub Action that validates spec compliance *and* proves each agent runs inside LangChain, OpenAI Assistants, and LlamaIndex.

*Why it matters:* We won’t invite guests into a half‑built house. This is our quality guarantee.

---

### **Phase 2 – Preparing to Welcome the World (Weeks 4‑7)**

**Goal:** Turn a solid repo into a hospitable community space.

* **Docs & Cookbook Site**
  Auto‑deployed static docs with copy‑paste recipes for three frameworks.

* **Live Contributor Channels**
  GitHub Discussions, a low‑noise Discord, and an “office‑hours” calendar.

* **Maintainer Collaboration**
  Personal invitations to upstream project owners; adding them to `CODEOWNERS` turns them from by‑standers into co‑stewards.

* **Recognition & Ops**
  All‑contributors bot, issue templates, and a 24‑h PR triage rota for launch week.

*Why it matters:* Great docs plus fast, friendly reviews are the two strongest signals that say “Yes, your contribution belongs here.”

---

### **Phase 3 – Our Community Launch (Week 8 and beyond)**

**Goal:** Go public with a focus on **collaboration and transparency**, not vanity fireworks.

* **Launch Blog & Demo**
  A narrative of *why* we built AgentHub this way, a 2‑minute live coding video, and a promise: “First PR review in under a day.”

* **Live Stream**
  We’ll build an agent file on air—mistakes allowed, questions encouraged.

* **Hacker News & Product Hunt Posts**
  The message: *“Help us write the missing agent for your favourite tool.”*

*What success looks like:* The comment threads become pull‑requests, not flame‑wars. Within 72 hours the first external agent is merged; within two weeks we see repeat contributors.

## 4. How We’ll Know We’re Winning

| **Health Signal**                             | **Target**           | **Why We Care**                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community PRs merged (first 72 h)**         | ≥ 3                  | Shows real interest, not drive‑by stars.              |
| **PR review turnaround (launch week)**        | ≤ 12 h               | Responsiveness is the first impression.               |
| **Repeat contributors (first 2 weeks)**       | ≥ 5                  | Indicates a welcoming process and meaningful work.    |
| **Public projects tagged #BuiltWithAgentHub** | ≥ 5 in first 14 days | Proof that the registry is *useful*, not just “neat.” |
| **Qualitative sentiment**                     | > 70 % positive      | Healthy discourse beats raw star counts.              |

*Vanity metrics like GitHub stars are nice but secondary; our true KPI is **engaged, returning collaborators**.*

---

## 5. Where *You* Fit In

* **Spec hawks** – Help bullet‑proof v0.1; find the edge cases.
* **Agent artisans** – Pair‑review founding agents or draft one yourself.
* **Doc whisperers** – Turn terse YAML into crystal‑clear cookbook pages.
* **Community champions** – Host office hours, triage issues, keep the tone generous.

If something feels muddy or misaligned with our **collaboration • transparency • quality** ethos—raise it. This manifesto is a living document.

### Let’s Build the Registry *We* Would Want to Contribute To

AgentHub isn’t a product dropped from a mountaintop—it’s a **conversation starter**.
With this plan, we’re inviting the developer community to sit at the table from day one.

**Quality over quantity. Transparency over hype. Collaboration over control.**
Stick to those values and success will follow—measured not just in stars, but in shared ownership and the momentum of builders who choose to stay.

*Onward, together.*
