# AgentHub

> **The open registry & spec for API‑savvy LLM agents — built in public, one thoughtful file at a time.**

---

## What AgentHub *Is* (and Intentionally *Is Not*)

| **We Are** | **We Aren’t** |
|------------|---------------|
| **An open specification** (`Open Agent Spec v0.1`) that any LLM stack can read. | A proprietary prompt framework or closed vendor format. |
| **A curated registry** of YAML agent files—each a peer‑reviewed guide to using a specific API or SDK. | A one‑click black‑box CLI or SDK. Developers copy‑paste—or parse—the YAML any way they like. |
| **A conversation starter**: every agent PR includes design notes, context, and room for debate. | A “big bang” drop of autogenerated assets with no community input. |

## Core Philosophy

* **Quality > Quantity** — We’d rather publish ten rock‑solid agents than a hundred flimsy ones.  
* **Transparency > Hype** — All design decisions, reviews, and mistakes happen in the open.  
* **Collaboration > Control** — Maintainers guide the vision, but contributors co‑own the future.

## How to Get Involved

1. **Read the [CONTRIBUTING guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** — it walks you through our PR‑based workflow.  
2. **Explore the founding agents** in [`/agents/`](./agents/) — they set the quality bar and include transparent `DESIGN_NOTES.md`.  
3. **Pick an API or SDK** that’s missing and start drafting your own agent. Draft PRs welcome!  
4. **Need help?** Open a Discussion or join our Discord office‑hours.

*(First‑time contributors are always celebrated — add yourself to the all‑contributors grid!)*
