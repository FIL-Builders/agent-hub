# Agent Hub

### 1 . Vision & Positioning

Build **AgentHub**—the Git‑style home for *opinionated, executable “agent files”* that teach LLMs how to use specific APIs, SDKs, and frameworks.
*Analogy:* *OpenAPI → REST endpoints* as \*\*AgentHub → “LLM endpoints.”\_
The platform becomes the authoritative registry where:

| Stakeholder                         | Core Value                                                                                                                         | Comparable Analogy         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **App developers**                  | Drop‑in, battle‑tested agent files that give any LLM instant “senior‑dev” knowledge of a stack (React + Redux, Stripe, Firebase…). | npm packages               |
| **Project teams / OSS maintainers** | Publish, version, and “own” the canonical agent for their API; reach thousands of downstream LLM workflows.                        | TypeScript‑DefinitelyTyped |
| **Agent authors / community**       | Create, fork, and monetize advanced agents (e.g., multi‑step flows, best‑practice guards).                                         | Hugging Face model hub     |
| **Enterprises**                     | Private, curated hub; compliance scans; metrics; on‑prem or VPC deploy.                                                            | GitHub Enterprise          |

| 11‑12 | **VS Code Extension**<br>• Autocomplete “Add Agent…”<br>• One‑click run in playground                                                                   | Converts curiosity → retention; minimal surface but high wow‑factor.                     |

**Tech stack (lean):** Next.js + tRPC, PostgreSQL (Supabase), GitHub Actions for spec‑lint & publish, simple S3‑style object store for agent files.

### 4 . Competitive Edge

1. **Opinionated quality bar** (lint rules, example tests, embedded citations) → avoids “prompt graveyards.”
2. **Neutral standard, open‑spec** → side‑steps model wars; any LLM can consume.
3. **Network effects via version‑pinning**: downstream apps reference `agent:react@^1.2` just like semver packages—lock‑in through convenience, not closed IP.
4. **Early partnerships** with top OSS frameworks (take the npm‑left‑pad lesson) give AgentHub canonical status.

### 5 . Critical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                       | Impact                             | Mitigation                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quality drift / malicious prompts          | Erodes trust                       | Automated static analysis (jail‑break patterns), community flagging, editor‑signed releases for “official” agents |
| API drift (breaking changes)               | Silent failures in downstream apps | “Live Canary” CI: run agent against sample code for each new library release; mark outdated versions              |
| Model‑provider changes (pricing, features) | Runtime costs & consistency        | Multi‑LLM abstraction in SDK, caching layer; negotiate bulk pricing                                               |
| Two‑sided marketplace cold‑start           | Slow growth                        | Seed supply: internally author top 20 agents; run bounty program (\$500/agent)                                    |

### 6 . Team & Budget (first 6 months)

| Role                | Headcount | Cost (USD)    | Notes                                         |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Founding PM/CEO     | 1         | 0 (equity)    | Drives vision & partnerships                  |
| Founding Eng. Lead  | 1         | \$60 k        | Full‑stack / infra                            |
| DX Engineer         | 1         | \$40 k        | Author starter agents, write docs, manage OSS |
| Part‑time Designer  | 0.5       | \$15 k        | Brand & minimal UI/UX                         |
| Cloud & misc.       | —         | \$10 k        | Supabase, hosting, auth, CI                   |
| **Total 6 mo burn** | —         | **≈ \$125 k** | Under typical pre‑seed cheque                 |

---

### 7 . Launch Checklist (“90‑Day Blitz”)

1. **Weeks 1‑2** – Publish v0.1 spec on GitHub, RFC on Lobsters/HN.
2. **Week 3** – Record a 10‑min demo: “From zero → Stripe‑powered checkout with LLM + agent in 60 s.”
3. **Week 4** – Blog series “Why prompt templates die; agents live.”
4. **Week 6** – Ship VS Code extension + Product Hunt launch (< 500 lines of code).
5. **Week 8** – Sponsor a DevPost hackathon; \$5 k prize pool for best agent‑powered app.
6. **Week 10** – Reach out to 20 OSS maintainers, offer free authoring help.
7. **Week 12** – Data‑driven case study: *X* SaaS cut onboarding prompts by 80 %, boosted conversion by 15 %.

---

### 8 . What “Good” Looks Like After 18 Months

* 5 – 10 k published agents; 30 % are “official” from API owners.
* AgentHub CLI is installed in >50 % of new LangChain starter repos on GitHub.
* ARR > \$3 M, split: 40 % enterprise hubs, 35 % marketplace fees, 25 % hosted runtime.
* Clear thought‑leadership moat—AgentHub spec becomes the de‑facto “schema.org for LLM tools.”

---

### 9 . Next Step Actions (for your team this week)

1. **Lock the spec surface**—list required fields (`name`, `version`, `context`, `capabilities`, `tests`) and optional metadata.
2. **Pick 3 flagship APIs** (React, Redux, Stripe) and draft their agent files internally to establish tone and depth.
3. **Set up a GitHub org** (`agenthub-spec`, `agenthub-registry`) and seed README with roadmap + contribution guide.
4. **Book intro calls** with 5 maintainers (e.g., React core, TanStack Query) to test appetite for “official agents.”
5. **Outline the 10‑minute demo script** and assign roles (dev, narrator, producer).

Execute these, and in three months you will have a credible, buzz‑worthy AgentHub alpha in developers’ hands—positioned to own the emerging standard for API‑aware AI agents.


Below is a streamlined, launch‑first rewrite of the original plan followed by an **`agenthub‑launch.yaml`** that encodes the entire eight‑week MVP push as a set of inter‑locking “product‑development agents.”
Everything not needed to generate immediate buzz (community marketplace, enterprise tier, score‑cards, etc.) is deferred.

---

## 1 . What We’re *Not* Shipping (Yet)

| Deferred Item                        | Rationale                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community agent marketplace**      | Solves a cold‑start two‑sided problem—skip until we have traffic.                                   |
| **Paid plans, private hubs, SOC 2**  | Pre‑revenue → no buyers; latency & cost issues are non‑blocking today.                              |
| **Badging / lint dashboards**        | Adds friction to authoring; trust can be earned later through early adopters and “official” agents. |
| **VS Code autocomplete playground**  | Nice‑to‑have; a simple **snippets + CLI** delivers 80 % of the wow with 10 % effort.                |
| **Multimodal / tool‑calling agents** | Focus first on text‑only API‑calling patterns; complexity explodes otherwise.                       |

---

## 2 . Core Thesis for Viral Traction

1. **Authoritative Pipeline Wins**
   *One* blessed way to define, version, and publish an agent file → zero ambiguity → zero yak‑shaving for devs.

2. **Zero‑to‑Demo in < 60 s**
   If a developer can run `npx agenthub add stripe` and watch ChatGPT wire a checkout flow before coffee cools, we win Hacker News.

3. **Project Team ↔ AgentHub Co‑Maintenance**
   “Official” agent ownership sits with the upstream project *and* us. We supply the scaffolding, tests, and release hooks; they merge updates.
   *Outcome:* agent stays fresh without our team becoming a bottleneck.

## 3 . MVP Scope (8 Weeks, Single Track)

| Week | Must‑Have Deliverable                                                                                                           | Key Success Metric                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Open Agent Spec v0.1** (+ JSONSchema & CLI validator)                                                                         | Spec merged & RFC up‑voted on HN (>50 comments).        |
| 2‑3  | **Agent Scaffolder CLI** – `agenthub create` wizards an opinionated skeleton incl. unit‑test prompts and “happy‑path” examples. | First “hello‑world” PR from an external dev.            |
| 3‑4  | **Mini Registry (Git‑backed)** – `agenthub publish` pushes to GitHub repo; CDN served via Cloudflare.                           | File fetched in demo <300 ms globally.                  |
| 4‑5  | **Runtime SDK (Node + Python)** – one helper `run_agent(agent_url, goal)` with streaming callbacks.                             | Stripe checkout demo runs end‑to‑end locally first try. |
| 5‑6  | **Flagship Agents (React, Redux, Stripe)** – co‑authored with project maintainers; stored under `official/` namespace.          | Maintainers tweet about it; 200★ on GitHub.             |
| 6‑7  | **CI Hooks Template** – GitHub Action that agent authors copy‑paste to re‑publish on library release.                           | 90 % freshness automation for flagship agents.          |
| 8    | **“60‑second Agent” Launch** – blog post, 2‑min terminal screencast, Product Hunt drop.                                         | 1 k GitHub stars in 48h, HN front‑page.                 |

---

## 4 . Org & Resourcing

| Function               | Headcount        | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Product / Spec Steward | **1**            | Owns RFC, evangelism, and maintainer relations. |
| Full‑Stack Engineer    | **1**            | CLI, registry, SDK, and launch demo.            |
| DevRel Engineer        | **½** (contract) | Writes sample apps, produces screencasts.       |

Total burn ≈ US \$60‑70 k for two months (well below typical pre‑seed).

### How to Read the File

* **agents**: atomic, owner‑assigned workstreams that behave like reusable development bots.
* **uses\_spec/depends\_on**: soft & hard dependencies (pre‑launch DAG).
* **success\_criteria**: crisp, externally verifiable outcomes—it’s obvious when an agent “done()”.
* **outputs**: concrete artifacts checked into the monorepo or CDN; nothing abstract.

Import this YAML into your project tracker (Linear, Jira, GitHub Projects) or feed it directly into an orchestration framework (e.g., Dendron, Baseplate) to spawn tickets automatically.
