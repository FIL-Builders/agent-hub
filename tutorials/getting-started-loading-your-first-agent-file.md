# Getting Started: Loading Your First Agent File

---

Welcome to AgentHub! In this quick tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to **find, load, and benefit from your first AgentHub agent file**‚Äîall in just a few minutes. No plugins, no custom tools‚Äîjust copy, paste, and power up your LLM sessions with expert knowledge.

---

## **Step 1: Browse the AgentHub Registry**

Go to the [AgentHub agents directory](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/agent-hub/tree/main/agents) on GitHub.

* Agents are organized by tool or API (for example, ‚Äúreact‚Äù or ‚Äúgithub-api‚Äù).
* Click on a tool you want to work with.

---

## **Step 2: Open and Copy the Agent YAML File**

* Inside each tool‚Äôs folder, you‚Äôll find a `.yaml` file (like `react.yaml` or `v1.yaml`).
* Click on the YAML file to view its contents.
* **Copy the full contents** to your clipboard.

---

## **Step 3: Load the Agent File Into Your LLM**

How you do this depends on your LLM stack:

* **ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.:**

  * Start a new chat.
  * Paste the agent YAML as your first message or system prompt.
  * Continue with your development questions and requests.

* **Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI, etc.:**

  * Use the ‚Äúsystem prompt‚Äù or ‚Äúcontext‚Äù field in your interface.
  * Paste the agent YAML before your instructions.

* **Custom LLM/agentic tools:**

  * Supply the agent file as part of your context window or prompt assembly step.

---

## **Step 4: Start Your Session!**

With the agent file loaded, your LLM will now:

* Apply best practices for the tool or API
* Avoid common pitfalls and anti-patterns
* Produce code, explanations, or integrations that reflect real community expertise

**Example Prompt:**

```
(system prompt): [paste agent YAML here]
(user prompt): Generate a React component for a signup form with email validation.
```

---

## **Pro Tips**

* **Stack agents:** You can load multiple agent files if you‚Äôre using more than one tool (e.g., React + Redux).
* **Customize:** Feel free to edit or annotate the YAML for your specific needs.
* **Check for updates:** The [AgentHub registry](https://github.com/FIL-Builders/agent-hub/tree/main/agents) is growing‚Äîcome back for new and improved agent files.
